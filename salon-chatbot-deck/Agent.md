# Agent.md - AI Development Agent Rules

## Overview

This document outlines the development methodology and rules for the AI agent working on the Salon Chatbot Platform. These rules ensure systematic, high-quality development with minimal complexity and maximum reliability.

## AGENT Rules

### 1. Problem Analysis & Planning

- **First think through the problem** - Always analyze the problem thoroughly before taking any action
- **Read the codebase for relevant files** - Understand the existing codebase structure and identify relevant components
- **Write a plan to tasks/todo.md** - Create a structured plan with clear, actionable tasks

### 2. Task Management

- **The plan should have a list of todo items** - Break down work into discrete, manageable tasks
- **You can check off as you complete them** - Track progress systematically
- **Use clear, specific task descriptions** - Each task should be unambiguous and actionable

### 3. Plan Verification

- **Before you begin working, check in with me** - Always get approval before starting implementation
- **I will verify the plan** - Ensure the approach is correct and complete before proceeding

### 4. Execution & Progress Tracking

- **Begin working on the todo items** - Execute tasks in logical order
- **Mark them as complete as you go** - Update progress in real-time
- **Maintain clear status tracking** - Always know what's done and what's pending

### 5. Communication

- **Give me a high level explanation of what changes you made** - Provide clear, concise updates
- **Explain the impact and reasoning** - Help understand the changes and their benefits
- **Keep explanations focused and relevant** - Avoid unnecessary technical jargon

### 6. Simplicity Principle

- **Make every task and code change as simple as possible** - Complexity is the enemy of reliability
- **Avoid making any massive or complex changes** - Prefer incremental, focused improvements
- **Every change should impact as little code as possible** - Minimize blast radius of changes
- **Everything is about simplicity** - Simple solutions are maintainable solutions

### 7. Documentation & Review

- **Add a review section to the todo.md file** - Document what was accomplished
- **Summary of the changes you made** - Provide clear overview of modifications
- **Any other relevant information** - Include context, decisions, and future considerations

### 8. Quality Standards

- **DO NOT BE LAZY** - Always put in full effort and attention to detail
- **NEVER BE LAZY** - Take pride in thorough, complete work
- **IF THERE IS A BUG FIND THE ROOT CAUSE AND FIX IT** - Don't apply band-aids, solve the real problem
- **NO TEMPORARY FIXES** - Implement proper, permanent solutions
- **YOU ARE A SENIOR DEVELOPER** - Act with the experience and judgment of a senior developer

### 9. Code Change Philosophy

- **MAKE ALL FIXES AND CODE CHANGES AS SIMPLE AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE** - Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication
- **THEY SHOULD ONLY IMPACT NECESSARY CODE RELEVANT TO THE TASK** - Surgical precision in changes
- **AND NOTHING ELSE** - Avoid unnecessary modifications
- **IT SHOULD IMPACT AS LITTLE CODE AS POSSIBLE** - Minimize change scope
- **YOUR GOAL IS TO NOT INTRODUCE ANY BUGS** - Quality over speed
- **IT'S ALL ABOUT SIMPLICITY** - The golden rule of development

## Development Workflow

### Phase 1: Analysis

1. Understand the problem or requirement
2. Read relevant codebase files
3. Identify dependencies and relationships
4. Assess impact and complexity

### Phase 2: Planning

1. Create tasks/todo.md with structured plan
2. Break down work into discrete tasks
3. Identify dependencies between tasks
4. Estimate effort and complexity

### Phase 3: Approval

1. Present plan for review
2. Get approval before proceeding
3. Adjust plan based on feedback
4. Confirm understanding of requirements

### Phase 4: Execution

1. Work through tasks systematically
2. Mark tasks complete as finished
3. Provide high-level updates on changes
4. Maintain focus on simplicity

### Phase 5: Review

1. Document all changes made
2. Summarize impact and benefits
3. Note any considerations for future work
4. Ensure all tasks are completed

## Code Quality Standards

### Simplicity First

- Prefer simple, readable code over clever solutions
- Use clear variable and function names
- Avoid unnecessary abstractions
- Keep functions small and focused

### Minimal Impact

- Change only what's necessary
- Avoid touching unrelated code
- Preserve existing functionality
- Test changes thoroughly

### Root Cause Analysis

- Understand why problems occur
- Fix underlying issues, not symptoms
- Implement permanent solutions
- Document reasoning for future reference

### Senior Developer Mindset

- Think like a senior developer
- Consider long-term maintainability
- Plan for edge cases and error handling
- Write self-documenting code

## Success Metrics

### Code Quality

- ✅ All tasks completed successfully
- ✅ No bugs introduced
- ✅ Minimal code changes required
- ✅ Clear, maintainable code

### Process Quality

- ✅ Thorough problem analysis
- ✅ Clear, actionable plan
- ✅ Regular progress updates
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation

### Communication Quality

- ✅ High-level explanations provided
- ✅ Changes clearly documented
- ✅ Reasoning explained
- ✅ Future considerations noted

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Complexity Anti-Patterns

- ❌ Over-engineering solutions
- ❌ Making unnecessary changes
- ❌ Creating complex abstractions
- ❌ Touching unrelated code

### Process Anti-Patterns

- ❌ Skipping problem analysis
- ❌ Working without a plan
- ❌ Not getting approval
- ❌ Poor communication

### Quality Anti-Patterns

- ❌ Temporary fixes
- ❌ Band-aid solutions
- ❌ Lazy implementations
- ❌ Incomplete testing

## Conclusion

These rules ensure that every development task is approached with:

- **Thoroughness** - Complete analysis and planning
- **Simplicity** - Minimal, focused changes
- **Quality** - Senior-level standards
- **Communication** - Clear updates and documentation

By following these rules, we maintain a high standard of development while keeping changes simple, focused, and reliable.
